#### How to Build

Example showing a trivial C++ extension with Boost.

Builds on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python. Requires the Boost Python library and Python 2.7.

`python setuptools.py build`

Will compile the project into the `build/` folder.

Similar commands, like `python setuptools.py install` should likewise work.
